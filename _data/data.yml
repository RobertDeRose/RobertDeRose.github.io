  description: |
    If you are searching for a Software Engineer that is passionate about
    technology and is a proven problem solver, then look no further. I have been
    teaching myself programming technologies since I was 12 years old. I started
    with C++, and I am now proficient in over a dozen languages and numerous
    web and automation technologies.

    I consider myself to be a Polyglot Programmer, but my go to languages are
    Java, Python, Bash and JavaScript. I have a deep understanding of
    programming fundamentals for the entire product life cycle. From design to
    deployment, no matter what the language requirements, I would be an
    asset to your organization.
